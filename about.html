								<h3>Project Description</h3>
								<p>Milk Matters is a non-profit human milk bank. Milk Matters’ core activities include motivating and facilitating the donation of human breast milk. A serious challenge faced by Milk Matters, and many other human milk banks, is encouraging mothers to donate. This project aims to investigate how technology, and in particular mobile applications, can be used to motivate mothers to donate their breast milk. In addition, the use of technology to educate mothers about breastfeeding, and human milk donation, will be investigated. In order to conduct our research, we developed a mobile application. The mobile application is intended to be useful for both mothers who are and mothers who are not currently donating their breast milk. The primary purpose of the mobile application is to convert mothers into donors, or encourage mothers who are already donors to increase their donation, without negatively affecting their own children. This will be achieved by providing mothers, and especially donating mothers, with helpful tools and information. This is thus a software engineering project, with a strong focus on using human computer interaction (HCI) and other techniques to influence users’ behaviour.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Project Significance</h3>
								<p>Human breast milk has vital nutritional and immunological properties that cannot be replicated in formula. Feeding infants human breast milk results in positive health outcomes. This is especially true for fragile infants, such as sick or premature infants in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs), whose immune systems may be weak. Furthermore, formula or alternate forms of food may result in health complications for some infants, such as those whose bodies are intolerant to it. For the reasons stated above, human milk is considered to be a vital medical resource and the ideal source of food for infants, as stipulated by the World Health Organisation (WHO).</p>

								<p>Unfortunately, the demand for human breast milk, and in particular milk from human milk banks, often exceeds supply. By using technology to motivate mothers to donate their excess breast milk, the supply of human breast milk to milk banks could be increased. As a result, more needy infants, such as those in NICUs could obtain access to human milk. This would likely result in positive health outcomes for those infants, and possibly even save lives. A secondary benefit of the application may be the useful breastfeeding oriented functionality and educational information it provides to mothers, regardless of whether they are donors or not. This breastfeeding oriented functionality and information may enable and encourage mothers to increase their own milk supply, for their own children, which may decrease the demand for donated human milk. A hopeful byproduct of educating mothers and enabling them to increase their own milk supply is converting them into donors, and encouraging them to donate more excess milk.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
								<p>Our project aims to address two core problems. The first problem relates mainly to human milk banks and their ability to provide human breast milk to needy infants, and the second problem relates directly to donor mothers:</p>
											<ol>
												<li>There is often a lack of motivation for women to donate excess breast milk to a human milk bank, despite the medical importance of human breast milk. Considering the demand for human milk bank milk generally exceeds supply, human milk banks are thus often only able to assist the neediest of infants.</li>
												<li>Mothers often lack information relating to both breastfeeding and breast milk donation (to human milk banks). The former hinders a mother’s ability to provide an infant with mother’s own milk, and thus increases the demand for donated breast milk. The latter decreases the supply of excess breast milk to human milk banks.</li>
											</ol>

								<hr />

								<h3>Aims</h3>
								<p>By addressing the two problems we identified, we aim to motivate mothers to donate excess breast milk to a human milk bank, and thereby increase the supply of breast milk to human milk banks. This will allow human milk banks to assist a larger number of needy infants. Furthermore, we aim to educate mothers about breastfeeding, the importance of human breast milk, and breast milk donation (to human milk banks). This will enable mothers to provide their children with mother’s own milk, and decrease the demand for human milk bank milk).</p>

								<p>In this software engineering project, we propose a technological solution to address the problems and achieve the broader objectives identified. Specifically, we aim to provide potential and current donor mothers with a mobile application they can use to: track their donations, receive feedback, and educate themselves about milk donation, breastfeeding, and general child care. This work aims to identify what donating mothers would value and find useful in an app, and then apply this knowledge in an effective manner, gathering user feedback to identify what is successful and what is unnecessary. The ultimate goal of the application, which will drive the design, functionality, and evaluation, is to motivate mothers to donate their excess breast milk to a human milk bank, and increase their donation where applicable.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Requirements</h3>
								<p>Our research takes on the form of a software engineering project, with Milk Matters as our primary clients.</p>

								<p>Milk Matters’ suggestions for the mobile application were as follows:</p>
											<ul>
												<li>Have an educational aspect. This may include lessons/diagrams on the pumping process, how to donate, increasing milk production, how to massage the breast, and how get their child to latch. </li>
												<li>In addition to educating mothers, mothers should be reassured about the rate of their donation and be reminded not to neglect their own child.</li>
												<li>Promote donation, or any other contribution like equipment, money or partaking in charity events.</li>
												<li>Provide data visualization for mothers donating with respect to quantities, contribution over-time, the impact of their donation, and baby growth.</li>
												<li>Inform mothers about locations for dropping off their donations (depot location).</li>
												<li>Provide functionality for Milk Matters to make notifications and announcements to mothers via the app.</li>
											</ul>
								<p>Extensive testing and prototyping was required to ensure we met the mothers’ needs, and provided Milk Matters with a satisfactory product that hopefully entices more donations and provides motivation to continue to do so.</p>
