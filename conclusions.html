								<h3>Conclusions</h3>
								<p>We deemed the Milk Matters mobile application to be a success for various reasons. Firstly, from a software engineering perspective, the application satisfied the majority of both our client's and end-users' most important functional and non-functional requirements. Where requirements were not met, Milk Matters were in agreement that the relevant functionality was unfeasible and/or non-essential. Secondly, it appears that the mobile application met the expectations of both Milk Matters and their donor mothers, based on the predominantly positive feedback we received. As such, it can be reasonably concluded that the iterative co-design process, coupled with an agile software development methodology, enabled us to balance and fulfil the needs and wants of both our client and end-users effectively. In addition, the project was a success from a design point of view. It was agreed that the application looked professional and was: easy and simple to use, aesthetically pleasing, and consistent with modern Android applications.</p>

								<p>Arguably most importantly, based on the responses of the mothers who participated in our study, it appears that the Milk Matters mobile application would likely motivate mothers to donate their excess breast milk to a human milk bank, and increase their donations where applicable. Similarly, mothers indicated that the application would improve their experiences as milk donors, and be of value to them. Mothers also indicated that the application provided them with appropriate and useful educational content from reputable sources, that would aid them in the breastfeeding and donation processes. The Milk Matters mobile application, and by extension this project, was thus a success, as it would likely achieve its ultimate aim of motivating mothers to donate their excess breast milk, and thereby increasing the supply of breast milk, to human milk banks.</p>

								<h3>Future Work</h3>
								<p>Potential future work for the Milk Matters mobile application itself mainly involves the back-end. At present, there is no formal, dedicated back-end which allows Milk Matters to easily update application content, such as the news and events or depot information. It would also be ideal if the back-end had a GUI, which would make it simple for Milk Matters to generate content for the application.  Finally, there still needs to be research into the extent to which such a mobile application actually does motivate mothers to donate their excess breast milk, and thus increase the supply of breast milk to human milk banks. Due to the short time frame of this project, and the numerous factors which influence both an individual mother's and the aggregate supply of breast milk, we were unable to obtain empirical evidence to support any conclusions on the matter. As such, this research remains as future work.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Limitations</h3>
								<p>The main limitation of this study arises from the nature of working with mothers, and particularly mothers with young children. Due to the constraints on mothers' time and energy, few mothers were able to commit to physically attending workshops and interviews. In fact, only two mothers managed to attend the initial workshop and follow-up interviews. However, we did not deem this to be a major issue, since the two mothers that attended provided us with sufficient feedback and suggestions. In order to compromise for the low attendance at these sessions, we sent out two comprehensive surveys that were primarily aimed at evaluation. The first survey achieved 41 responses. However, as mentioned, the second survey was met with a poor response, and the results were consequently omitted from this project. It must, therefore, be noted that this work might not be representative of the opinions of most donor mothers.</p>
