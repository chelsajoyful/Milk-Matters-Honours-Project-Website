								<h3>Developement Procedures</h3>
								<p>We chose to develop an Android application, due to the openness of the platform and minimal resources required to develop for it. Android has the majority share of the worldwide smartphone operating system market, which means that our application is likely to reach and benefit an optimal number of users. Android phones are also typically cheaper than their iOS counterparts, which makes development and testing less costly, and makes the mobile application accessible to a larger user base. In order to build our Android application, the Android Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) was used. Similarly, the standard Android Software Development Kit and development tools were used. We coded the application in Java, which is both the native language for Android and our preferred coding language. Our team made use of the Git version control system to manage our code and collaboration.</p>

								<hr />

								<h3>Development Methods and Practices</h3>
								<p>Our project is primarily a software engineering project. We followed a co-design process with Milk Matters and their milk donor mothers. In order to facilitate the co-design process we made use of an agile software development methodology. Specifically, the project included three iterations of a "design, prototype, and evaluate" cycle. The agile development method was appropriate for us, given the short amount of time the project spanned, and the low number of developers and stakeholders involved in the project. Iterative/agile development allowed us to interact with stakeholders throughout the design process, and allowed us to be more flexible in the face of evolving requirements and desires. This is particularly important considering there were no set requirements or ideas pertaining to what the app should be, or do.</p>

								<p>We began by building a skeleton, or core, for the application, into which functionality could be added. The purpose for this was to ensure that the application was as modular as possible, and its features/components could be developed and added independently. The skeleton/core of the application was developed by both Chelsea and Mitchell using pair programming. This ensured that the application had a strong base, with a design that effectively incorporates all the features/components to be added by both coders. Once the skeleton had been created, functionality could be developed and added independently by Chelsea and Mitchell, as per the work split. All code produced independently by Chelsea and Mitchell was checked by the other person, in order to ensure correctness and completeness.</p>

								<p>The co-design process with Milk Matters and their donor mothers included the following:</p>
								<ol>
												<li>Initial meeting with Milk Matters</li>
												<li>Brainstorming and paper prototyping workshop with the donor mothers</li>
												<li>Initial requirements gathering survey</li>
												<li>Follow-up interviews and cognitive walkthroughs with donor mothers</li>
												<li>Evaluation meeting with Milk Matters</li>
												<li>Live deployment and follow-up survey</li>
								</ol>

								<hr />

								<h3>Evaluation Measures and Acceptance Testing</h3>
								<p>Our project was evaluated from a software engineering perspective and, ultimately, according to how well it fulfils its intended real world purpose. Evaluation of our project was both quantitative and qualitative in nature. In order to maintain the privacy of users, the application does not send any personal information, such as quantities donated, to Milk Matters. As such, directly tracking the real world increase in the supply of breast milk, or attainment of donors, due to the mobile application was not feasible. One could not reliably state, without access to the donation patterns and app usage of donors, that an increase in human milk supply, or donors, was a result of the app. The fact that our project runs over a short amount of time, and the application did not achieve widespread use, makes evaluation of the application’s real world impact even more difficult.</p>

								<p>As a result of the above, the application and success of our project was evaluated primarily by assessing mothers’/donors’ opinions and perceptions of the application. This information was gathered using interviews, workshops, cognitive walkthroughs and surveys. By assessing mother’s opinions, we can infer how useful/valuable the app is to them, and to what extent it is likely to motivate them to donate their breast milk. These opinions are evaluated both quantitatively, using a series of statements pertaining to the app and a 5 point Likert scale, and qualitatively, using open ended questions to attain a deeper understanding of mothers’ perceptions of the app. The most important criteria for quantitative and qualitative evaluation and testing will be mothers’ opinions of:
											<ul>
												<li>How useful and valuable the app was to them</li>
												<li>Whether it is educational and provides useful, relevant information</li>
												<li>Whether it meets their expectations of what the application should be able to do (within reason)</li>
												<li>How easy, convenient, and intuitive the app is to use</li>
												<li>Whether the app is too time consuming and cumbersome (for a mother)</li>
												<li>How interactive and rewarding the app is</li>
												<li>Whether the app improves the milk donation experience, and makes it more immersive</li>
												<li>Whether it would motivate them to become a donor</li>
												<li>Whether it would motivate them to increase the frequency and quantity of their donations</li>
											</ul></p>
		
								<p>The application has also been evaluated more specifically as a technological/software engineering entity. Firstly, the application was assessed according to how well we met Milk Matters’ and their donor mothers’ expectations and requirements, within the bounds of what could reasonably be considered in scope. Another important component of our evaluation was how well the application conforms to Human Computer Interaction design and usability principles, and Android standards. The application was also be rigorously tested for bugs and other anomalies. Should the application be a success both from a software engineering perspective and in achieving its real world purpose, then our project surely has been successful.</p>
