							<h2>Ethical, Professional and Legal Issues</h2>
							<p>Ethical issues were identified in the testing, software implementation, educational content and data handling stages of the project. Each will be discussed in further detail here.</p>
						</header>

							<div class="inner">

								<h3>Testing</h3>
								<p>Ethical clearance was obtained from the UCT Human Research Ethics Committee before interaction with the donor mothers. This was accomplished by submitting an ethical admittance form to the committee prior to the initial workshop session and interviews. The donor mothers were then emailed a description of the project, their roles in it and their rights. Attached was the ethics statement form that they would be required to give consent to at the physical session. The form and meaning of it was explained at every donor meeting/interaction. Furthermore they were assured that any records (audio recording, pictures and names) would be anonymized and they could withdraw from the project at any time.</p>
